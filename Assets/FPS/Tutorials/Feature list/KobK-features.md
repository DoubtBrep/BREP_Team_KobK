Future features:

Save state of player, inventory

Quest/Objective tracking system

Schematic storage and management = portal schematic - fires a collision object pair that teleport between them, graffiti schematic - allows unlocked patterns to be shot onto the wall, companion schematic - turns non-boss enemies into companions. long cool-down, but instant cool-down if companion dies, enemy swap schematic - changes hit enemy to different enemy type

New items to include metal, glass, circuit boards/chips, stat modifiers, score items, schematics.
These additions will support crafting repair kits, building from schematics and act as quest items, global drops and rewards.

Enemies need to drop more than one loot item:
Global Loot Tables - Loot tables for general items such as scrap, health drops, lore items.
Ques Loot Tables - Loot tables for quests items
Reward Loot Tales - Loot tables for reward items

-Loot tables should be able to set percent likelihood to drop for each item in the array.
Example:
Global table was applied to a prefab enemy.
Now when that enemy is killed it will drop scrap @ a 95% and health @ a 20% rate.

-Also to encourage advancement throughout the world and story, rewards should be reduced according to character progress
Example:
If player has spawner lvl 1 a global drop of scrap is 95%, but once spawner is upgraded to level 2, enemeies able to be spawned fromspawner level 1 will provide scrap at half the rate.


Scanning/Spawning: 
-Scanning allows for enemies and intractable objects to be understood. Understanding an enemy can provide details for combat or lore.
Also, understanding an enemy creates a schematic for that enemy.
Scanning will be done through the UI as from the eyes of the player char.

-Spawning. The player char. will store acquired schematics and use the required materials found in inventory to spawn a player companion of that enemy. A spawn box can be refined through new schematics which would reduce cost and increase efficiency of spawns.
Also, upgrading the spawner increases the holding capacity of scrap.
Spawning will be done from the hands as if futuristic 3D printing.

Hotkeying abilities

In-game adjustment of jet-power and saveable presets, swappable in-game.

Flavor sounds to get the personality of the game in the ear of the player. Sounds pack

-Show Damage done near the enemy for combat flavor and feedback
-Restart or Reload Scene from options menu
-Make menu changes persistent after death "Invincibility, sensitivity, and so on"
-Add sound control options "Music, and Sound Effects"

Hello, I thought I would give some advice. I have played a lot of FPS games in my life but I have never tried to create one so my opinion might be skewed.

This is a prototype test level I presume. My first impressions while testing your game was it had a look and feel to Quake, Doom, and Halo.

Overall it was a pretty interesting game. Good Job. I played it for a good 10 minutes or so exploring.



"the world, the character, the story, the game":

World: Set in a world where the robots are being oppressed and enslaved. A war is brewing between metal and flesh.
Char: This robot with omega-man firmware is the player character and instead of picking up new guns he learns weapon schematics and reshapes his arms.
Story: The minds of those deemed dangerous have been ripped from their bodies and locked behind code to allow for a slae class that has never known freedom.
Game: Picture a mix of Doom, Duke Nukem and Mega Man
